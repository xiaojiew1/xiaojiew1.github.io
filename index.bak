I work on developing novel machine learning algorithms for providing users with their desired search and recommendation results. These search and recommendation results better satisfy users' information need and personal preference in terms of several criteria such as diversity. To provide such search and recommendation results, I build upon several state-of-the-art machine learning techniques including generative adversarial networks, doubly robust estimators, learning to optimize, etc.
